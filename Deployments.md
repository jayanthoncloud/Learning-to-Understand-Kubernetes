# Working with Kubernetes Deployments
A Kubernetes Deployment tells Kubernetes how to create or modify instances of the pods that hold a containerized application. Deployments can help to efficiently scale the number of replica pods, enable the rollout of updated code in a controlled manner, or roll back to an earlier deployment version if necessary.

Kubernetes saves time and mitigates errors by automating the work and repetitive manual functions involved in deploying, scaling, and updating applications in production. Since the Kubernetes deployment controller continuously monitors the health of pods and nodes, it can make changes in real-time—like replacing a failed pod or bypassing down nodes—to ensure the continuity of critical applications.
